Radon is a Python tool that computes various metrics from the source code.
Radon can compute:

* **McCabe's complexity**, i.e. cyclomatic complexity
* **raw** metrics (these include SLOC, comment lines, blank lines, &c.)
* **Halstead** metrics (all of them)
* **Maintainability Index** (the one used in Visual Studio)

Requirements
------------

Radon will run from **Python 2.6** to **Python 3.3** with a single code base
and without the need of tools like 2to3 or six. It can also run on **PyPy**
without any problems (currently only PyPy 2.0.0 is tested).

Radon does not depend on any other Python package (except *Baker* for the
command line, but it is an optional dependency).

Installation
------------

With Pip::

    $ pip install radon

Or download the source and run the setup file::

    $ python setup.py install

Usage
-----

Radon can be used either from the command line or programmatically.
Documentation is WIP at https://radon.readthedocs.org/.

Cyclomatic Complexity Example
-----------------------------

Quick example::

    $ radon cc -anc ../baker/baker.py
    ../baker/baker.py
        M 581:4 Baker.parse_args - D
        M 723:4 Baker.parse - D
        M 223:4 Baker.command - C
        M 796:4 Baker.apply - C
        M 857:4 Baker.run - C

    32 blocks (classes, functions, methods) analyzed.
    Average complexity: B (6.15625)

Explanation:

* ``cc`` is the radon command
* ``-a`` tells radon to calculate the average complexity at the end
* ``-nc`` tells radon to print only results with a complexity rank of C or
  worse. Other examples: ``-na`` (from A to F), or ``-nd`` (from D to F).

Actually it's even better: it's got colors!
